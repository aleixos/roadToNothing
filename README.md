My iOS jailbreak journey...
I love apple products, who doesn’t? My journey started with iPhone 3GS iOS 4 wow how cool was that back in the day jailbroken using RedSnow and unlocking to any network, how cool is that, I got thinking how on earth is all of this done, started looking at objective C wow it was like reading Chinese, made a very simple parallax scrolling game yea cool I’m a pro now, haha not, ok it’s time for $THEOS and mobileSubstrate, yea that’s easy, not! Ok Flex2 is cool and dumpz is really useful, cycript is amazing! Point is: 10 years later and I’ve got nothing to show for my knowledge. I thought I would share this with the world maybe somebody can relate to this, nevertheless I love it lol... :p
